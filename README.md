## Research Experience

* **N-body Galaxy Simulation Using Barnes-Hut Algorithm (Thompson, Knabel, Waters 2020)**
  * Conducted Fall 2020, advised by Dr. Shudun Liu.
  * We model the overdensities in the intergalactic medium in order to simulate the formation of a galactic structure using in a gravitational N-body simulation using the Barnes-Hut Algorithm.
